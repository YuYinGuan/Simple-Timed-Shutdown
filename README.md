# Simple-Timed-Shutdown

This is made while learning VS and is in no way perfect. Feel free to improve or use the program.

The program allows you to enter the amount of minutes before window shutdown. Stoping button will stop the timer. For reset timer, please close program and re-open.

Compatible with window 8 and 10. Haven't tested with window 7 or below.
